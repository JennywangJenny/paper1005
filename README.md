# paper1005 - WebGL demo

## Introduction
This program is the WebGL demo of the paper Seamless Mipmap Filtering for Dual Paraboloid Maps, which is accepted by the conference Pacific Graphics 2019. It demonstrates the omnidirectional soft shadows using dual paraboloid map mipmaps and cubemap mipmaps. It is implemented using WebGL and *Three.js library*. The demo can be browsed with Chrome on any Android device with a decent GPU theorectically.

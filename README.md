# WebGL demo - paper1005

## Introduction
This program is the WebGL demo of the paper _Seamless Mipmap Filtering for Dual Paraboloid Maps_, which is accepted by the conference Pacific Graphics 2019. 

It demonstrates the omnidirectional soft shadows using dual paraboloid mapping and mipmapping. It is implemented using WebGL and _Three.js library_. The demo can be browsed with Chrome on any Android device with a decent GPU theorectically.
